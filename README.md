# Enta
## A Tracker for Your Movies and TV.
Live demo -> https://enta.netlify.app/

Currently, the app works as a tracker for your movies and TV shows. I intended this to be a tracker only app.
But the below improvements can be further made!

1. Add a show more button or enable the cards to be clickable to take to a page with further details about the title.
2. Add a play button to the card to make a streaming app.
3. Add a progress bar to the card.
4. Home page can be improved by adding more lists such as popular, trending, top rated like in the movies and TV page.
5. React Native version? I'll be making it responsive enough anyway.

### Cloning Instructions

1. After cloning, run `npm install` in the directory to get the dependencies.
2. Update the firebase config to your details in src/firebase/firebase.utils.js.
3. Update the TMDB API key to yours, though you can use mine.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
